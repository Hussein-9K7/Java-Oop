a) Why does an arrival event need to generate a new arrival event?

An arrival event needs to generate a new arrival event because the simulation needs to represent a continuous flow of arrivals.
In real-world systems, arrivals happen at different time intervals.
Therefore, when an arrival occurs, the next arrival time is determined by generating a new arrival event.

b) Which event should be generated by the start of the service (of a single service point)?

At the start of the service, a departure (or exit) event should be generated.
This event represents the moment when the service will be completed, determining the departure time of the client and freeing up the server.
To handle the next client.
