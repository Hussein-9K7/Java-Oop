Real-World Operational System: Bank
Variability:
Number of Customers: The number of customers visiting the bank varies each day. On some days,
there may be congestion during specific times, such as the beginning of the month or after holidays.

Types of Transactions: The transactions carried out by customers vary. Some customers may come only for withdrawals,
 while others may come to deposit, apply for loans, or exchange currency.

Transaction Time: The time it takes for a customer to complete a transaction differs based on the type of transaction.
For example, withdrawing money takes less time than opening an account or discussing a loan.

Complexity:
Account Management: The bank must manage numerous accounts and currencies. There should be a system to track financial transactions,
 calculate interest, and ensure account security.

Staff Management: The bank needs to coordinate employees in different roles such as cashiers,
loan officers, customer service, and security. Organizing work between these employees is complex to ensure smooth operations.

Technology System: The bank relies on computer systems for performing transactions, keeping records,
and executing calculations. Any malfunction in the technological system can significantly affect daily banking operations.

Interconnectedness:
Customer and Employee Interaction: Customer behavior directly impacts the workflow. For example,
if there are many customers in one queue, it may cause delays for other transactions. Employees must also cooperate to meet customer needs.

Banking Systems: Transactions between the bank and customers are interconnected with other systems,
such as payment systems or credit card services. Any malfunction in one of these systems could affect the entire bankâ€™s operations.

Financial Resources: Banks are closely linked with financial markets. When changes happen in financial markets,
like currency fluctuations or interest rate changes, these can affect the bank's operations.

Conclusion:
The banking system involves many factors that make it complex. Variations in customer numbers, transaction types,
and transaction times all affect how operations run. Coordination between employees and the use of technology
for transactions presents significant challenges. In the end, the interaction between customers, employees,
and the technological system helps improve workflow in the bank.
